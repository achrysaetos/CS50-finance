        Stock typically takes the form of shares of either common stock or preferred stock. 
        As a unit of ownership, common stock typically carries voting rights that can be exercised in corporate decisions. 
        Preferred stock differs from common stock in that it typically does not carry voting rights but is legally entitled 
        to receive a certain level of dividend payments before any dividends can be issued to other shareholders. 
        Convertible preferred stock is preferred stock that includes an option for the holder to convert the preferred 
        shares into a fixed number of common shares, usually any time after a predetermined date. 
        Shares of such stock are called "convertible preferred shares" (or "convertible preference shares" in the UK).</h4>
        <h4 style="float: left;">
        New equity issue may have specific legal clauses attached that differentiate them from previous issues of the issuer. 
        Some shares of common stock may be issued without the typical voting rights, for instance, or some shares may have 
        special rights unique to them and issued only to certain parties. Often, new issues that have not been registered 
        with a securities governing body may be restricted from resale for certain periods of time.</h4>
        <h4 style="float: left;">
        Preferred stock may be hybrid by having the qualities of bonds of fixed returns and common stock voting rights. 
        They also have preference in the payment of dividends over common stock and also have been given preference at the 
        time of liquidation over common stock. They have other features of accumulation in dividend. In addition, preferred 
        stock usually comes with a letter designation at the end of the security; for example, Berkshire-Hathaway Class "B" 
        shares sell under stock ticker BRK.B, whereas Class "A" shares of ORION DHC, Inc will sell under ticker OODHA until 
        the company drops the "A" creating ticker OODH for its "Common" shares only designation. This extra letter does not 
        mean that any exclusive rights exist for the shareholders but it does let investors know that the shares are considered 
        for such, however, these rights or privileges may change based on the decisions made by the underlying company.</h4>
