    A stock derivative is any financial instrument for which the underlying asset is the price of an equity. 
    Futures and options are the main types of derivatives on stocks. The underlying security may be a stock index 
    or an individual firm's stock, e.g. single-stock futures.</h4>
    <h4 style="float: left;">
    Stock futures are contracts where the buyer is long, i.e., takes on the obligation to buy on the contract 
    maturity date, and the seller is short, i.e., takes on the obligation to sell. Stock index futures are 
    generally delivered by cash settlement.</h4>
    <h4 style="float: left;">
    A stock option is a class of option. Specifically, a call option is the right (not obligation) to buy stock 
    in the future at a fixed price and a put option is the right (not obligation) to sell stock in the future at 
    a fixed price. Thus, the value of a stock option changes in reaction to the underlying stock of which it is a 
    derivative. The most popular method of valuing stock options is the Blackâ€“Scholes model. Apart from call options 
    granted to employees, most stock options are transferable.</h4>

    "Rule 144 Stock" is an American term given to shares of stock subject to SEC Rule 144: Selling Restricted and 
    Control Securities. Under Rule 144, restricted and controlled securities are acquired in unregistered form. 
    Investors either purchase or take ownership of these securities through private sales (or other means such as 
    via ESOPs or in exchange for seed money) from the issuing company (as in the case with Restricted Securities) 
    or from an affiliate of the issuer (as in the case with Control Securities). Investors wishing to sell these 
    securities are subject to different rules than those selling traditional common or preferred stock. These individuals 
    will only be allowed to liquidate their securities after meeting the specific conditions set forth by SEC Rule 144. 
    Rule 144 allows public re-sale of restricted securities if a number of different conditions are met.</h4>
